   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd musica-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
   ```bash
   # Database
   DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"
   
   # AI Provider (choose one)
   XAI_API_KEY="your-xai-api-key"
   # or
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
   
   # Authentication
   AUTH_SECRET="your-auth-secret"
   AUTH_GITHUB_ID="your-github-oauth-id"
   AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET="your-github-oauth-secret"
   
   # Guest Access (optional)
   GUEST_PASSWORD="your-guest-password"
   ```

4. **Database Setup**:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:generate
   pnpm db:migrate
   ```

5. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Your app will be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Guest Authentication

The application supports guest access for users who want to try features without creating an account:

1. **Set Guest Password**: Add to your `.env.local`:
